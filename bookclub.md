You are assigned the following project:

A local bookstore would like to launch a website for it's customers. The website should feature contact information and opening hours for the shop, an online catalog of featured books available in store, a calendar of forthcoming author and promotional events and an online 'book club' for registered users of the website. Registered users will be allowed to vote on the next 'book of the month' and submit comments on the current book of the month.

A proof of concept website must be built and tested for client approval. A design document should be produced, including coding standards which will be applied and their justification.

The client is open to suggestions about enhancements to the website which should be included in the proof of concept.
