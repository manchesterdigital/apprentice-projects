You are working for a computer services company and have been assigned the following project:

Your tram company would like to rebuild their website to better serve their customers. 

The website must feature an area where service updates can be displayed 

Customers should be able to use the website to purchase tickets online. Ticket prices are as follows:

Title | Price 
---- | ------- |
Adult, peak, city zone  | £2.00
Adult, off-peak, city zone | £1.50
Adult, peak, all zones | £3.00
Adult, off-peak, all zones | £2.60
Child | £1.20
Family (2 adults, 2 children), all zones | £5.00




* All tickets are returns and can be purchased and activated at any time, and the website should advise customers of the restrictions applied to peak and off peak tickets. The website should apply the best deal available to customers.

* The website should keep track of and allow customers to activate their purchased tickets
